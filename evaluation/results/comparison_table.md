## Analysis of Results

The evaluation shows that the web search address validation functionality is not working effectively:

1. **Web Search Triggering**: The web search was triggered for all articles (100%), which is expected since all initial addresses were set to "unknown" with "low" confidence.

2. **Address Extraction**: Despite the web search being triggered, no addresses were successfully extracted from the search results. This indicates a problem with the address extraction logic or the search results themselves.

3. **Success Rate**: The success rate is 0%, meaning none of the addresses were correctly identified through web search.

## Potential Issues

Based on the evaluation results, the following issues may be affecting the web search address validation:

1. **Mock Web Search Results**: The mock web search function in test_web_search.py always returns the same results about a Palm Desert jewelry store robbery, regardless of the query. This doesn't provide relevant results for the specific articles being analyzed.

2. **Address Extraction Patterns**: The regular expression patterns used for address extraction may not be matching the formats in the search results.

3. **Location Context**: The location information from the articles is not being properly incorporated into the search queries or address validation.

4. **Business Name Recognition**: The business names are not being effectively extracted or used in the search process.

These issues will be addressed in the refinement phase to improve the web search address validation functionality.

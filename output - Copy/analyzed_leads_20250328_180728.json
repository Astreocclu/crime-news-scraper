    "reasoning": "The article mentions a string of smash-and-grab robberies at several jewelry stores in NW Harris County, Texas. While the specific business names and locations are not provided, the fact that it was a series of incidents at multiple jewelry stores in the same general area suggests a higher-value target. The smash-and-grab method also indicates a lack of effective security measures, further increasing the lead quality. However, without more details on the individual stores, inventory, and security, the lead quality score is limited to a 6."

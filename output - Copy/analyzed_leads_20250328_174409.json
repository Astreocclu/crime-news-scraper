    "reasoning": "The Diamond Emporium is a high-end jewelry store that was targeted in a brazen smash-and-grab robbery, resulting in the theft of an estimated $500,000 worth of luxury items. The fact that the thieves were able to breach the reinforced glass storefront suggests that the existing security measures failed to prevent the break-in. This, combined with the high-value inventory and upscale location, makes this a very attractive lead for a security company looking to provide solutions to prevent similar incidents in the future. The lead quality score is high due to the potential for a lucrative contract to secure a high-profile, high-value target."

    "lead_quality_score": 8,
    "reasoning": "This incident involves a chain jewelry store with high-value inventory that was targeted in an overnight break-in where the existing security measures failed. The fact that it is a chain store means the security company could potentially implement solutions at multiple locations, increasing the lead quality. Additionally, the upscale location and high-value inventory contribute to a higher lead quality score."

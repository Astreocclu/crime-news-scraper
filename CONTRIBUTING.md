# Contributing to Crime News Scraper

Thank you for considering contributing to the Crime News Scraper project! This document outlines the guidelines and workflow for contributing to the project.

## Development Process

### Code Organization

The project follows a modular architecture:

```
.
├── src/
│   ├── scrapers/           # Scraper modules
│   │   ├── base.py        # Base scraper class
│   │   ├── jsa/           # JSA scraper module
│   │   │   ├── config.py  # JSA-specific configuration
│   │   │   ├── scraper.py # JSA scraper implementation
│   │   │   └── utils.py   # JSA utility functions
│   │   └── dfw/           # DFW scraper module
│   └── analyzer/          # Analysis module
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── analyzer.py    # Main analyzer implementation
│       └── claude_client.py # Claude API integration
├── tests/                 # Test files
├── output/                # Generated output files
└── requirements.txt       # Project dependencies
```

### Testing Workflow

The project follows a specific testing workflow to ensure reliability:

1. **Create Test Copy**
   - Copy the current working file to a test file (e.g., `analyzer.py` → `test_analyzer.py`)
   - This preserves the working version while testing changes

2. **Test Implementation**
   - Make changes and test the new functionality in the test file
   - Verify all features work as expected
   - Debug and fix any issues

3. **Merge Changes**
   - Once testing is complete and successful, merge the test file back into the main implementation
   - Ensures a clean, working codebase
   - Avoids confusion about which files to run

### Adding a New Scraper

To add a new scraper:

1. Create a new module in `src/scrapers/`
2. Implement the base scraper interface defined in `base.py`
3. Add configuration in the module's directory
4. Update the unified scraper to include the new module

Example structure for a new scraper:

```
src/scrapers/new_source/
├── __init__.py
├── config.py        # Source-specific configuration
├── scraper.py       # Scraper implementation
└── utils.py         # Utility functions
```

## Code Style Guidelines

1. **PEP 8**: Follow the [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guide for Python code.
2. **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions.
3. **Type Hints**: Include type hints for function parameters and return values.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages.
5. **Logging**: Use the logging module instead of print statements.

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
3. Make your changes
4. Add tests for your changes
5. Ensure all tests pass
6. Update documentation if necessary
7. Submit a pull request

## CI/CD Pipeline

A robust CI/CD pipeline would include:

1. **Automated Testing**:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for component interactions
   - End-to-end tests for full workflow

2. **Linting and Code Quality**:
   - Code style checks (flake8, black)
   - Static type checking (mypy)
   - Security vulnerability scanning

3. **Deployment Stages**:
   - Development environment deployment for testing
   - Staging environment for pre-release validation
   - Production environment for final deployment

4. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Performance monitoring
   - Error tracking and alerting
   - Usage statistics

Setting up this pipeline would involve:
- Configuring GitHub Actions or similar CI service
- Creating testing, linting, and deployment workflows
- Setting up environment-specific configurations
- Implementing monitoring and alerting solutions

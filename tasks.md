# Crime News Scraper: Functional Implementation Tasks

**Status**: Project organization complete ✅. Focus: Core functionality implementation and issue resolution.

**Current State**: 242 articles, 42 analysis results, 149 nearby businesses in database. Address validation system has 0% success rate (critical issue).

**Agent Instructions:** Execute tasks sequentially, prioritizing critical functionality fixes. Log progress in `implementation_progress.md`. Consult `memories.md` for operational principles.

**CRITICAL:** Do NOT move `tasks.md` or `memories.md` from root directory.

    * [x] **Sub-task 1.1.2:** List the contents of the `src/`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `output/`, and `evaluation/` directories.
        * `src/` contains: address_finder/, analysis/, analyzer/, crime_news_scraper/ (with nearby_finder/), nearby_finder/, scrapers/ (with multiple source-specific scrapers), utils/
        * `scripts/` contains: analyze.py, create_complete_scrape.py, export_analysis_to_csv.py, generate_test_data.py, nearby.py, run_analysis_db.py, run_analyzer.py, run_finder_batches.py, run_workflow.py, scrape.py, test_*.py files, workflow.py

        * `evaluation/` contains: evaluation scripts, test scripts, README.md, recommendations.md, results/ directory with evaluation results
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.1.3:** Identify file types and potential purposes. Note misplaced files in the root directory.
        * Misplaced files in root: analyzer.log, direct_augment_test.log, web_search_test.log (log files that should be in logs/)
        * Source code: Python files in src/ directory
        * Tests: Python files in tests/ directory
        * Scripts: Python files in scripts/ directory
        * Documentation: Markdown files in docs/ directory

        * Logs: Log files in logs/ directory and some in root
        * Data: Sample/test data files in data/ directory
        * Output: Generated files in output/ directory

* **Task 1.2: Define Target Structure**
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.2.1:** Confirm the proposed standard structure.
        * The proposed structure in tasks.md is appropriate and follows common Python project standards.
        * All necessary directories are included in the proposed structure.
        * The structure properly maintains `tasks.md` and `memories.md` in the root directory.
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.2.2:** Define the purpose of each top-level directory.
        * `config/`: Stores configuration files such as settings, constants, and non-sensitive configuration parameters.
        * `data/`: Contains input data and sample files used for testing and development.
        * `docs/`: Houses project documentation including guides, instructions, and contribution guidelines.
        * `evaluation/`: Contains scripts and data specifically for evaluating the performance of the system.
        * `logs/`: Stores runtime log files generated by the application components.
        * `output/`: Contains generated output files from the application's operations, organized by type.
            * `output/analysis_results/`: Stores structured analysis output (CSVs, JSONs) from the analyzer.
            * `output/nearby_businesses/`: Contains output from the nearby business finder.
            * `output/reports/`: Houses generated reports, summaries, and diagnostics.

* **Task 1.3: Plan File/Folder Migrations**
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.3.1:** List files in root directory that should be moved.
        * Log files to move to `logs/` directory:
            * `analyzer.log`
            * `direct_augment_test.log`
            * `web_search_test.log`
        * No other files in the root directory need to be moved (excluding `tasks.md`, `memories.md`, `README.md`, `requirements*.txt`, `.env*`, `.gitignore`)
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.3.2:** Plan restructuring of the `output/` directory.
        * Create new subdirectories if they don't exist:
            * `output/analysis_results/`
            * `output/nearby_businesses/`
            * `output/reports/`
            * `output/scraped_data/`
        * Move files from existing directories to new structure:
            * Move files from `output/analysis/` to `output/analysis_results/`
            * Move files from `output/nearby/` to `output/nearby_businesses/`
            * Move files from `output/reports/` to `output/reports/` (if needed)
            * Move files from `output/scraped_data/` to `output/scraped_data/` (if needed)
            * Move files from `output/scraping/` to `output/scraped_data/`
            * Move log files from `output/logs/` to the top-level `logs/` directory
        * Remove old directories after migration:
            * `output/analysis/`
            * `output/nearby/`
            * `output/logs/`
            * `output/scraping/` (if all files moved successfully)
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.3.3:** Plan consolidation of scripts from `src/` subdirectories.
        * Identify potential scripts to move to `scripts/` directory:
            * Any standalone scripts in `src/address_finder/` that are used for testing or examples
            * Any standalone scripts in `src/analyzer/` that are used for testing or examples
            * Any standalone scripts in `src/nearby_finder/` that are used for testing or examples
        * Keep evaluation-specific run scripts in `evaluation/` directory
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.3.4:** Plan consolidation of test files into `tests/` directory.
        * Identify test files to move to appropriate subdirectories in `tests/`:
            * Any `*_test.py` or `test_*.py` files in `src/` subdirectories
            * Specifically check for `src/analyzer/analyzer_manual_test.py` and move to `tests/test_analyzer/` if it's a test
        * Ensure test files are placed in directories that mirror the `src/` structure
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.3.5:** Check if `src/crime_news_scraper/` contents can be moved directly under `src/`.
        * `src/crime_news_scraper/` contains `nearby_finder/` which appears to be duplicated with `src/nearby_finder/`
        * Need to compare the two directories to determine if they contain the same functionality
        * If they are duplicates, keep `src/nearby_finder/` and remove `src/crime_news_scraper/nearby_finder/`
        * If they contain different functionality, move `src/crime_news_scraper/nearby_finder/` to `src/` with a different name
        * After migration, remove the empty `src/crime_news_scraper/` directory

* **Task 1.4: Plan Documentation Updates**
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.4.1:** Plan additions to `README.md` for "Project Structure" section.
        * Add a new "Project Structure" section to `README.md` after the introduction/overview
        * Include a brief description of each top-level directory and its purpose
        * Highlight the importance of `tasks.md` and `memories.md` in the root directory
        * Use a tree-like structure to visually represent the directory organization
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.4.2:** Plan to review/update paths and commands in documentation.
        * Review and update paths in the following files:
            * `README.md`: Check installation and usage instructions for correct paths
            * `docs/QUICK_START.md`: Ensure commands and paths reflect the new structure
            * `docs/instructions.md`: Update any references to file locations
            * `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: Update development workflow and directory structure references
        * Pay special attention to script paths and output directory references
    * [x] **Sub-task 1.4.3:** Decide on creating `docs/STRUCTURE.md` or integrating into `README.md`.
        * Decision: Add a concise "Project Structure" section to `README.md` with essential information
        * Create a more detailed `docs/STRUCTURE.md` file that includes:
            * Comprehensive description of each directory and subdirectory
            * Explanation of key files and their purposes
            * Guidelines for where to place new files
            * Relationships between different components

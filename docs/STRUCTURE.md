## Directory Purposes

### Top-Level Directories

- **`config/`**: Stores configuration files such as settings, constants, and non-sensitive configuration parameters. YAML files in this directory provide a more maintainable configuration format that can be loaded by the application.

- **`data/`**: Contains input data and sample files used for testing and development, such as sample articles, test data, and HTML fixtures.

- **`docs/`**: Houses project documentation including guides, instructions, and contribution guidelines. This includes files like QUICK_START.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and other documentation.

- **`evaluation/`**: Contains scripts and data specifically for evaluating the performance of the system, including test scripts, evaluation metrics, and results.

- **`logs/`**: Stores runtime log files generated by the application components, such as application.log, analyzer.log, and scrapers.log.

- **`output/`**: Contains generated output files from the application's operations, organized by type:
  - **`output/analysis_results/`**: Stores structured analysis output (CSVs, JSONs) from the analyzer. Files follow the naming convention `YYYYMMDD-FileType.ext` (e.g., `20250329-AnalyzedLeads.csv`).
  - **`output/nearby_businesses/`**: Contains output from the nearby business finder. Files follow the naming convention `YYYYMMDD-NearbyBusinesses.csv`.
  - **`output/reports/`**: Houses generated reports, summaries, and diagnostics. Files follow the naming convention `YYYYMMDD-ReportType.ext`.
  - **`output/scraped_data/`**: Stores raw scraped data from various sources. Files follow the naming convention `YYYYMMDD-SourceArticles.csv` or `YYYYMMDD-CompleteScrape.csv`.

- **`scripts/`**: Contains utility and helper scripts for running different components of the system, such as run_workflow.py, run_analyzer.py, and other convenience scripts.

- **`src/`**: Houses the main source code of the application, organized by component:
  - **`src/address_finder/`**: Address finding and validation module.
  - **`src/analyzer/`**: Analysis module for processing articles.
  - **`src/nearby_finder/`**: Module for finding nearby businesses.
  - **`src/scrapers/`**: Scraper modules for different news sources.
  - **`src/utils/`**: Utility modules for logging, exceptions, etc.

- **`tests/`**: Contains automated tests that mirror the structure of the `src/` directory, including unit tests, integration tests, and fixtures.

### Special Files

- **`tasks.md`**: Contains the task list for the project. This file should not be moved from the root directory.

- **`memories.md`**: Contains operational memory and principles for the project. This file should not be moved from the root directory.

- **`.env`**: Contains environment variables including API keys and configuration settings. This file should not be committed to version control.

- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the main dependencies required to run the application.

- **`requirements-dev.txt`**: Lists additional dependencies required for development and testing.

## Component Relationships

- The **scrapers** collect data from various news sources and store it in the database or CSV files.
- The **analyzer** processes the collected data to extract business information and analyze crime incidents.
- The **address_finder** enhances the data with accurate address information.
- The **nearby_finder** identifies additional businesses near the crime incidents.
- The **database** module provides a central storage mechanism for all components.
- The **utils** module provides shared functionality used by multiple components.

## File Placement Guidelines

- **Source Code**: All application code should be placed in the appropriate subdirectory of `src/`.
- **Tests**: All test files should be placed in the appropriate subdirectory of `tests/`.
- **Scripts**: Utility and helper scripts should be placed in the `scripts/` directory.
- **Configuration**: Configuration files should be placed in the `config/` directory.
- **Documentation**: Documentation files should be placed in the `docs/` directory.
- **Logs**: Log files should be placed in the `logs/` directory.
- **Output**: Generated output files should be placed in the appropriate subdirectory of `output/`.
